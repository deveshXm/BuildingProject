# Metaverse project
The metaverse project mimics housing.com slice view which allows users to take a detailed look at the building from both outsider and inside. The project was made using WebGL and ThreeJS. The user is allowed   to zoom in and out of the building and rotate to get full 360-degree view of the building. The user also gets four options in which the first one is the slice/building view which on click provides user the interior floor view of the building and if clicked again it returns back to the building view or the outer view of the building. The second and third option basically enable/disable rotation and movement of the camera. The fourth option is double click event when the user is inside the slice view, it provides more detailed view of the rooms present at the particular floor.
